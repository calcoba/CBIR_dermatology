# CBIR_dermatology

All the functions that are necessary to create the CBIR are implemented in the script **auxiliary.py**.

The notebook **demonstration.ipynb** has been created to show how these functions work, and to provide an example with our own dataset.

If the user is interested in using his or her own images to use the retrieval system, the only requirement is to gaher them (including the query one) in a **data** folder available in the same location than the notebook and to run it again. Notice that all of them should be of the same size.
